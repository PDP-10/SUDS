SUDS, the Stanford University Drawing System.

This repository contains a complete set of files from SUDS as found in
the Saildart archive.  There are also some bits and pieces from ITS.

These programs from ITS seem to work:

- D
- LAY
- NODIPS
- PC
- WL

Unfortunately, there is no WAITS system on which to try the SAIL
programs.

ITS files are encoded in the "evacuate" format.  SAIL files are
encoded in ANSI-ASCII format; NUL characters in text can be ignored.
